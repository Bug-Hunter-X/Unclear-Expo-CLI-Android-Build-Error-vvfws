The solution often involves carefully reviewing the Android build configuration. In some cases, cleaning the build cache might resolve the issue.  Check the following:

1. **Verify Android SDK and NDK versions:** Ensure that you have the correct and compatible versions of the Android SDK and NDK installed.  Outdated or mismatched versions can cause build issues.
2. **Check Gradle configuration:** Examine your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files to ensure they are properly configured and consistent with Expo's requirements.
3. **Clean the build cache:**  Try cleaning the build cache by running `expo run:android --clear` or manually deleting the `.gradle` cache directories.
4. **Examine dependency versions:** Review your project dependencies to look for conflicting versions.  Update any outdated packages, resolving dependency conflicts.
5. **Check for typos and syntax errors:**  Careful review of your `app.json` file will eliminate some causes. 
6. **Consult Expo documentation:** Expo's official documentation provides valuable troubleshooting tips and solutions for common build errors.
7. **Check the full log:** Scrolling through the complete error output may reveal hidden details leading to the root cause.
